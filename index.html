        <h2> Welcome to my portflio</h2>

        <p>I've been and artist since I was 16 years old. I took my first real art class sophmore year in highschool<br>
          and drew a hugh portrait of myself on my own. Thats when I knew that I had a gift!<br>
          I continue to take art classes throught out highschool but i had another dream of bring a physical therapist. Within the<br>
          fisrt semester of college I switched my major for health sciences back to art because I realized thats where I belong.<br>
          I switched my major for are to grapgic design becuase I stasrted to merge for drawing and painting to computer art.<br>
          I love Grapic Design and im so happy I found something I love and dont mind waking up and doing everyday!<br>
          </p>
        <p>This is were all my creative skills is displayed!</p>

          <p>This project is one of the biggest projects i've done so far being a grapic designer.<br>
            I created everything displayed except the mockups. This project is creating a desert food truck brand.<br>
            I created a menu, logo, the good truck wrap, and the take away cups that customers will see and use.<br>
